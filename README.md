# Solar System Planets Recognition :milky_way::telescope:
## Description :page_with_curl:
Development and training of a neural network capable of recognizing all de Solar System Planets (including Pluto)

## Datasets :open_file_folder:
All de images used for the trainig, validation and testing of the neural network has been chosen from the websites of recognized astronomical organizations like [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/index.html), [Gran Telescopio de Canarias](http://www.gtc.iac.es), and others. You can take the dataset from kaggle by clicking this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fernandosanfielreyes/solar-system-planets).

## Data Augmentation
The Data augmentation has been preformed with the full dataset and then with a python script all the dataset was randomly divided between training, validation and testing.
